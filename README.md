# DD4hep
This repository is related to the step-by-step installation of Detector Description for High Energy Physics (DD4hep) with GEANT4 and LCIO using LXPLUS.
On your lxplus account, navigate to the file /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org/ from which you can leverage the key4HEP environment, which provides pre-configured setups for DD4hep, Geant4, and LCIO.
### 1. Set up the Environment
Begin by sourcing the Key4HEP environment, which provides a consistent software stack including DD4hep, Geant4, LCIO, and related tools.
```
source /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org/key4hep/setup.sh
```
